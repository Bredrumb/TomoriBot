title: "Multi-Persona System"
---

The multi-persona subsystem manages server-scoped character identities, coordinating one main persona and multiple alter personas. It governs identity persistence, single-owner trigger routing, sequential reply queuing, and webhook-based chat rendering while sharing conversation history and server configuration.

Official bundled presets follow a copy-on-write pointer model described in [Persona Presets](/architecture/subsystems/persona-presets/).

## Data model and ownership

Persona identity and behavior are stored across four core tables:

### `personas`

Each row defines a persona identity in a server:

- `is_alter`: `false` for the main persona; `true` for alter personas.
- `webhook_avatar_url`: Stored avatar reference. In production this is an object storage URL. In non-production environments it references a local file under `data/avatars/`. For unforked preset pointers, this is `NULL` and resolves the shared catalog URL live.
- `applied_avatar_hash`: For main preset pointers, the content hash last applied to the Discord guild member avatar by the background reconciler.
- `persona_lineage_id`: Scopes memory, conditioning history, and prompt inspection. Derived from preset lineage on creation, but preserved independently during pointer materialization.

### `persona_configs`

Holds per-persona behavior settings:

- `trigger_words`: Array of trigger strings for the persona.
- `humanizer_degree`: Optional per-persona humanizer level override. When set, state loading overlays this value onto the persona's assembled configuration so providers and stream buffers see persona-scoped humanization without call-site awareness.

### `persona_sprites`

Stores named avatar variations selected by generated render modifiers:

- `sprite_name`: Display label presented in prompt instructions.
- `sprite_key`: Normalized key for case-insensitive lookup.
- `avatar_url`: Object storage URL or local development asset path.
- `usage_instructions`: Guidance injected into the prompt describing when to adopt the sprite.
- `is_identity`: When `true`, renders the decorated `sprite (SourcePersona)` username directly in Discord (DID alter style). When `false`, renders the clean persona nickname.

Pointer personas resolve sprites live from `preset_sprites` via `PersonaSpriteRepository.listForPersona()`. Materializing a persona copies these rows by reference.

### `reminders`

Stores scheduled reminder tasks:

- `persona_id`: Identifies the persona that created the reminder. Delivery runs with that persona's identity, falling back to the main persona if the creating persona was deleted.

## Triggering and routing

### Direct routing

Incoming messages route through these priorities:

- **Direct bot replies**: Replying to a message sent by the bot user routes to the main persona.
- **Webhook replies**: Replying to an alter webhook message routes to that alter by matching `message.author.username` to persona nicknames.
- **Bot mentions**: Mentioning the bot routes to the main persona.
- **Explicit trigger words**: Matching strings in `persona_configs.trigger_words` activate the matching personas.

Direct replies and mentions can combine with trigger words in the same message, scheduling multiple personas to respond.

### Single-owner trigger resolution

Because official character presets include the shared base name (`tomori`), pointer personas resolving triggers live would all match the same name simultaneously. `PersonaRepository.applyTriggerWordOwnership()` prevents collisions by assigning single ownership whenever a server's persona set is assembled:

1. **Main persona**: Reserves the locale's base trigger words from `getAllBaseTriggerWords()`, preventing alter personas from claiming the bot's core name.
2. **Alters in creation order**: Evaluated in ascending `persona_id` order. The oldest alter claims contested words; later alters drop them.

This deduplication runs at read time, so routing remains consistent across imports, materialization, and preset updates.

### Turn queuing and cascade limits

When an incoming message triggers multiple personas:

- `planChatTurns` in `src/utils/chat/turnPlanner.ts` identifies all matching personas.
- The first persona executes immediately.
- `queueAdditionalPersonaTurns()` in `src/utils/chat/personaQueue.ts` serializes subsequent personas by inserting them at the front of the channel lock queue (`queuePersonaJobsAtFront`). Personas respond consecutively before newer user messages in the queue.

To prevent uncontrolled cascades, `server_chat_configs.cascade_limit` (default 3) and `match_limit` (default 3) constrain activations:

- **First trigger free**: The initial persona activation in a trigger session does not consume the cascade budget.
- **Shared counter**: All subsequent automatic triggers in the session (multi-persona co-matches or persona-to-persona chain mentions) increment a channel-scoped counter.
- **Bypass**: Slash commands (`isManuallyTriggered = true`) and stop responses bypass the cascade counter.
- **Session reset**: The counter resets when a real user sends a message or after 30 minutes of inactivity (`SELF_REPLY_CHAIN_TTL_MS`).
- **Streaming interrupts**: If an incoming message carries an explicit trigger for a different persona while a stream is active, it bypasses follow-up mode and queues as a separate turn.

## Context isolation and participant profiles

Multi-persona turns within the same request share sanitized visible history through `prepareParticipantContext()`:

- A `ParticipantRequestScope` attached to `LockedChatTurn` memoizes discovery for equivalent sanitized
  inputs. Changed history gets a separate entry; each preparation call recomposes the active persona
  and hydrates its profiles. Queued persona jobs can acquire a fresh lock and scope.
- The active persona is excluded from public participant profiles.
- Co-responders and personas referenced by trigger text in visible history are injected into conversation participants with their public attributes and physical appearance tags.
- Private attributes remain visible only to their owning persona.
- Tool loops and function-call histories remain strictly isolated per persona turn.

## Rendering and delivery

Main and alter personas use different Discord delivery mechanisms:

```
Incoming Turn
  ├── Main Persona  ──> Discord Bot User (Guild Member Nickname)
  └── Alter Persona ──> Shared Channel Webhook ("TomoriBot Multi-Persona")
                         ├── Username: persona nickname or sprite label
                         └── AvatarURL: S3 URL / local asset / shared preset
```

### Webhook delivery

Alters deliver through a shared channel webhook (`TomoriBot Multi-Persona`):

- **Identity overrides**: Each send specifies `username` (persona nickname) and `avatarURL` (`webhook_avatar_url`).
- **Historic identity resolution**: `getReplyContextAuthorName()` in `src/utils/discord/webhookReply.ts` differentiates message authors. Webhook messages read `message.author.username` (stripping bridge prefixes). Bot messages read the available member display name. This is the member name available during reconstruction, so later nickname changes can affect attribution.

### Copied rendering and sprites

A persona can render lines with sprite avatars or copied identities using leading modifier syntax:

```text
SourcePersona (target): message
```

Resolution follows this sequence:

1. **Sprite match**: Matches `persona_sprites.sprite_key` on the active persona. Ordinary sprites (`is_identity = false`) render the clean persona nickname in Discord; identity sprites (`is_identity = true`) render `sprite (SourcePersona)`. To prevent Discord from grouping consecutive messages under the first avatar, alternating messages fall back to decorated usernames. Delivered mappings are recorded in `persona_sprite_messages` so context rebuilding restores model-facing labels.
2. **Copied identity**: Resolves `target` against known personas and conversation users, rendering `target (SourcePersona)` with the target's avatar.
3. **Plain output**: Unmatched modifiers are stripped before delivery.

### Embeds and stickers

- **Tool embeds**: Tool results sent via `sendStandardEmbed` reuse the persona webhook identity when available.
- **Stickers**: Webhooks cannot dispatch native Discord stickers. For alters, TomoriBot posts the sticker CDN preview URL via webhook; if delivery fails, it falls back to a standard bot message.
