title: "Tool System"
---

The tool system owns tool registration, availability filtering, dynamic schema assembly, and execution dispatch across built-in tools and guild Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. The bot starts no local or stdio MCP server. Model orchestration, multi-turn tool loops, and result serialization belong to the [tool loop](/architecture/pipelines/tool-loop/).

## Registration and availability filtering

Tool registration and discovery coordinate through two core modules:

- **Registration (`src/tools/toolRegistry.ts`):** Built-in tools implement `BaseTool` and register with `ToolRegistry.registerTool()`. Provider tool adapters convert declarations only; dispatch never routes through them.
- **Availability filtering (`src/tools/availability.ts`):** `getAvailableToolsWithMCP()` provides centralized availability checks before tools are exposed to the model.

Filtering evaluates multiple layers:

1. **Provider support:** The tool must declare compatibility with the active LLM provider via `isAvailableFor(provider)`.
2. **Model capabilities:** The tool's `requiredModelCapabilities` must match active model flags in `ToolAvailabilityLlmState`.
3. **Feature flags:** Tools requiring feature flags (`requiresFeatureFlag`) are evaluated against guild configuration via `configToFeatureFlags`.
4. **Channel permissions:** Tools with `requiresPermissions` verify that the bot holds necessary Discord channel permissions (such as `SendMessages` or `UseExternalStickers`).
5. **Backend slot availability:** Feature tools verify configured backend slots before admission. `generate_image` requires a standard diffusion model; `generate_image_nai` requires a NovelAI image slot; `generate_video` requires a video model slot; and `generate_voice_message` requires a speech provider and an assigned persona voice.
6. **Streaming context filtering:** `applyStreamContextAvailability()` evaluates live-turn constraints (`isAvailableForContext`) before schema declaration. This removes tools whose turn eligibility has lapsed (such as per-turn deduplication flags) so unavailable tools are not advertised to the model.

## Dynamic tool assembly

Before provider serialization, tools pass through `assembleToolsForContext()` in `src/tools/assembly.ts`. Most tools return their static definition unchanged. Capability-sensitive tools implement `assembleForContext(context)` and return tailored variants via `createToolVariant()`:

- `web_search`: Narrows category enums to the active search backend. SearXNG exposes all categories; Brave exposes text, image, video, and news; and the built-in DuckDuckGo fallback exposes text search only.
- `generate_image`: Prunes parameters to match active backend capabilities (text-to-image, reference image fields, and ComfyUI inpaint or outpaint controls). Parameter descriptions omit instructions for unconfigured modes, preventing the model from receiving unsupported guidance.
- `generate_voice_message`: Prunes script markup and voice instruction schemas based on the active speech endpoint and persona voice design. Delivery logic is shared with `/generate voice-message`; see [Voice System](/architecture/integrations/voice/).

Assembly guards prevent the model from seeing unsupported parameters, while execution-time checks guard against stale configurations and crafted tool calls.

## Execution dispatch and failure boundaries

Tool execution coordinates through a single entry point: `ToolRegistry.executeTool()`.

```
Model tool call
       ↓
ToolRegistry.executeTool()
       ↓
Resolve opaque IDs (media_id, message_id) & aliases
       ↓
Dispatch:
├─ Guild MCP Manager ──→ guildMcpManager.executeGuildMCPFunction()
└─ Built-in Tool     ──→ tool.execute() (availability & context checked)
       ↓
Redact parameters & record ToolExecutionEvent
       ↓
Return ToolResult (success / error)
```

Execution dispatch enforces the following rules:

1. **Alias and opaque ID resolution:** Built-in aliases (`BUILTIN_TOOL_ALIASES`) resolve to canonical names. Opaque identifiers (`media_id`, `message_id`, `end_message_id`) resolve to Discord snowflakes via `MessageIdMap` before reaching tool code.
2. **Guild MCP dispatch:** Advertisement and dispatch use `getGuildMCPRouting()` for the actual workspace and exact enabled registration. Only explicit `url_fetcher` and `web_search` selections can replace their corresponding built-in family. Dispatch checks the family's existing `web_search_enabled` switch again.
3. **Built-in tool execution:** `executeBuiltInTool()` reuses the availability predicate for provider support, model capabilities, declared feature flags, live context, and declared bot permissions. Dispatch refreshes workspace feature switches before executing, including after asynchronous discovery. Unavailable or stale MCP configuration reads preserve unrelated built-ins and their aliases with those checks; remote calls and native fetch/search refuse because the current replacement selection cannot be verified. Tool code still owns target access, invoking-user authorization, quotas, and backend-specific validation. These checks preserve internal engine calls and do not create a new administrator restriction.
4. **Execution history and redaction:** Parameters are sanitized via `redactToolParametersForStorage()` before recording in `ToolExecutionEvent` history.
5. **Error handling:** Thrown exceptions are caught and wrapped in a structured `ToolResult` with `success: false` and a localized or descriptive error message. The error returns to the model turn so the persona can adapt or explain the failure; see [Execute Tool Call](/architecture/pipelines/tool-loop/02-execute-tool-call/).

## Guild MCP integrations

Guilds manage remote MCP servers through `/config` > Plugins > MCP Servers (`src/utils/mcp/mcpConfigOperations.ts`):

- **Connection pooling and lifecycle:** `GuildMcpManager` (`src/utils/mcp/guildMcpManager.ts`) connects servers lazily during tool gathering. Streamable HTTP and SSE use fresh clients bounded by `GUILD_MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`. Both use `guildMcpFetch.ts` for the shared URL gate, pinned DNS, same-origin requests without URL credentials, and redirect refusal. A response stops at 8 MiB before SDK JSON or SSE parsing, including discovery and internal rule checks. The cap applies cumulatively to each SSE response stream. Result envelopes must pass the SDK's schema before storage. A `*.run.tools` registration with a key connects through `smitheryConnection.ts` instead: the Smithery SDK is pinned to `api.smithery.ai` for both Connect setup and the MCP endpoint it returns, every request uses the same guarded fetch, and setup plus discovery share one `GUILD_MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` deadline because the stateless transport sends nothing before `tools/list`. A connection ID derived from the upstream URL makes reconnects reuse one remote connection, which also lets an administrator finish Smithery authorization for it. The key never reaches the upstream URL, even after a Smithery failure, and setup failures surface only fixed messages.
- **Circuit breaker quarantine:** Servers that fail to connect enter quarantine for `GUILD_MCP_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_MS` (default 5 minutes). This prevents unreachable endpoints from exhausting connection timeouts on every generation turn.
- **Tool name snapshots:** Discovered tool names persist in `last_discovered_tool_names` as a bounded display cache, capped at 100 names and 128 Unicode characters per name (`mcpToolSnapshot.ts`). Live `listTools()` output remains authoritative for invocation.
- **Collision and replacement policy:** All built-in names and aliases remain reserved even when disabled. A selected `url_fetcher` may supply `fetch_url`; a selected `web_search` may supply `web_search`. Other collisions are hidden and cannot intercept dispatch. Unfamiliar discovered names retain their schemas. Prompt macros, deliberate tool filtering, follow-up handling, and execution use the same family selection. Each family permits one enabled registration. Disable the old selection before enabling its replacement. Existing duplicate family selections or duplicate tool names across servers are refused until the administrator resolves the ambiguity. An unavailable selected service never silently switches to the native tool. With no selection, native search and fetch remain the defaults.

Selected remote fetch/search servers are administrator-trusted network runtimes. Where a discovered schema identifies a URL field, the bot checks that input through the existing fetch destination gate before calling the server. This preflight cannot control the server's DNS, redirects, subresources, or download bytes. The transport controls above govern the bot's connection to that server. The MCP registration panel explains this distinction before registration.

## Web tools and network security

Web access tools enforce security boundaries before network dispatch:

- `web_search`: Tries the Brave, SearXNG, and DuckDuckGo engines in that order and returns the first success. Engine-specific names stay hidden from the model. DuckDuckGo reads its fixed HTML results endpoint through the strict pinned fetcher, with a deadline and a 1 MiB cap, and sends no credentials. It unwraps result links without following them. A challenge, rate limit, or changed markup returns a failure, so the model cannot mistake a blocked search for zero results. Search results are untrusted model input.
- `fetch_url`: The primary URL-reading tool. In production (`RUN_ENV === "production"`), requests to private, localhost, or reserved IP ranges are blocked unless `FETCH_URL_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true` is set. A hostname that does not resolve is refused in every environment.
- **Crawl4AI engine:** Optional. Setting `CRAWL4AI_BASE_URL` puts it ahead of `safe_http`, but only where private-network fetching is permitted. Its external browser resolves DNS, follows redirects, and loads subresources itself, so the bot's preflight and metadata denylist do not cover those requests. Responses are read under a byte limit and checked for the expected shape before use. See [Setup: Crawl4AI](/self-hosting/local-endpoints/setup-crawl4ai/).
- **Cloud metadata protection:** Cloud instance metadata and link-local ranges (`169.254.0.0/16`, IPv6 link-local, AWS IMDS) are blocked unconditionally by `src/utils/security/cloudMetadata.ts`. This check cannot be bypassed by configuration.
- **Safe HTTP engine:** The `safe_http` engine validates and pins DNS, follows a bounded number of redirects (revalidating each hop), limits downloaded byte counts, and converts HTML to Markdown.
- **Result storage:** Successful content is stored in `ToolResult.data.summary` so streaming tool loops serialize the text into provider turn history.

## Participant targeting

Participant-aware tools resolve user and persona targets through `ParticipantTargetIndex` attached to the prepared participant context; see [Participants](/architecture/pipelines/context-build/02-native-assembly/06-participants/). The index is constructed from typed identities and purpose-filtered aliases, avoiding ambiguous display-name searches.

For image analysis, `analyze_image` resolves attachments from the target Discord message. When that message is a text-only reply, it checks the directly referenced message. The tool enforces the `VISION_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_MS` deadline (default 60 seconds) across media downloads and vision provider inference.

## Persona user blocking

The `block_user` and `unblock_user` tools allow personas to manage interpersonal boundaries, gated by the `user_blocking_enabled` permission in `/config`:

- **Scoping:** Blocks persist in `persona_user_blocks`, keyed by server, local persona ID, and target user ID.
- **Channel permission check:** Before saving a block, `block_user` checks whether the bot can view the channel and send embeds. Missing permissions abort the save and return an error to the model.
- **Dialogue filtering:** Active blocks suppress the target user's messages in dialogue history, replacing them with a system notice: `[System: ... sent a message but is currently blocked by you ...]`. The notice is an English system injection, mirroring reminder and join injections. Blocking suppresses dialogue turns and reply annotations without deleting stored long-term memories or documents.

## Structured user info updates
<!-- anchor: structured-user-info-updates -->

The `update_user_info` tool (`src/tools/functionCalls/updateUserInfoTool.ts`) updates personal profile and addressing preferences:

- **Target resolution:** Resolves target users across mentions, names, aliases, and Discord IDs using `resolveUserTarget`. Omitted targets default to the invoking user; wildcards (`all`, `everyone`) are rejected.
- **Field scoping:**
  - Persona-specific fields (`nickname`, `prefix`, `suffix`) persist in `user_persona_naming_preferences`, scoped to the active persona lineage.
  - Global fields (`gender_identity`, `pronouns`, `addressing_style`, `timezone_offset`) persist in `user_personalization_configs`, shared across all personas.
- **Clearing values:** Fields listed in the `clear` array are removed. Submitting empty string values folds into clearing. Cleared prefixes or suffixes persist as explicit suppressions (`none`), preventing lower-precedence defaults from resurfacing.
- **Affix deduplication:** When a submitted nickname contains an already-resolved prefix or suffix, redundant affixes are stripped by comparing against resolved values.
- **Privacy and permissions:** Mutations require `user_info_updates_enabled`. Restrictive privacy levels block updates but permit clearing existing values.

## Capability self-diagnosis

The `review_capabilities` tool inspects system configuration dynamically:

- **Inventory sources:** Gathers active tools from `ToolRegistry` runtime availability and registered commands from cached `loadCommandData()`.
- **Privilege boundaries:** General members receive safe reports detailing commands and feature states. Detailed reports containing credential presence, rotation pool counts, internal identifiers, and system-prompt metadata require the requesting member to hold `ManageGuild` permissions. Invocations without verified member context fail closed with the redacted report.

## NovelAI constraints

The `fetch_url` tool is excluded from NovelAI models. NovelAI tool calling is prompt-based and token-constrained, requiring dedicated budget validation before large URL payloads can be admitted.
