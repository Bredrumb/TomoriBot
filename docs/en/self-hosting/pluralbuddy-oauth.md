The bot host must authorize one PluralBuddy application per instance so TomoriBot can verify webhook reposts. People
using your bot select PluralBuddy in Discord; they do not create applications or supply tokens.

## Before you start

- Run the current TomoriBot version against a migrated PostgreSQL database.
- Use a computer with a browser and access to that database and TomoriBot's encryption key. The
  authorization helper listens on that computer's loopback address. If the database is remote,
  arrange temporary, restricted access from this computer.
- Choose an unused local port and register one exact callback URL in the developer portal, for
  example `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/oauth/callback`. Record this URL; you will use it in every
  step below.

## Authorize the official instance

1. Sign into the [PluralBuddy developer portal](https://pluralbuddy.app/developers/applications)
   and create an OAuth application. Use a separate application for testing. Select `profile` and
   `offline_access`. Register your callback exactly as chosen above. Keep the client ID and secret
   private. The PluralBuddy bot's Discord invitation does not grant TomoriBot API access.
2. From the TomoriBot repository, run the helper with the official instance ID and the same callback:

   ```sh
   bun scripts/db/authorize-pluralbuddy-instance.ts pluralbuddy:official <callback-url>
   ```

3. Enter the client ID and secret at the terminal prompts. Open the printed authorization URL in
   the browser on that computer, sign into PluralBuddy, and approve the consent screen. The helper
   closes after one callback or three minutes and stores the connection in PostgreSQL.
4. Start TomoriBot with the same database and encryption key. Select
   `/personal message-proxy service:pluralbuddy` on a Discord account that uses PluralBuddy, then
   send a webhook repost to check that TomoriBot recognizes the alter.

The helper reads PostgreSQL settings and `CRYPTO_SECRET` or versioned encryption keys from `.env`
or a `SECRET_FILE` JSON bundle accessible only to the bot host. Keep the bundle outside the repository. Enter the
client secret at the prompt; do not place it in a command argument or Discord message. If PluralBuddy
revokes the connection, repeat these steps with the same instance ID. A failed selection leaves the
user's current message-proxy choice unchanged.

## Where the OAuth credentials go

The helper stores the client ID, encrypted client secret, and encrypted refresh token in the
`pluralbuddy_oauth_connections` database table. TomoriBot uses the encryption key from `.env` or
`SECRET_FILE` to read them and renew access. The OAuth client secret does not belong in `.env`, and
the bot no longer reads `PLURALBUDDY_CLIENT_ID` or `PLURALBUDDY_CLIENT_SECRET` variables.

## Add an approved instance

The custom origin must serve a proxy bot and its matching API. An API URL alone cannot make the
public PluralKit or PluralBuddy bot write records there. The first version accepts public HTTPS
origins only: no path, query, fragment, user information, private address, loopback address, or
link-local address. The bot rechecks DNS before each request and never follows redirects on lookup
or token requests.

1. On a computer with deployment database access, register a disabled instance:

   ```sh
   bun scripts/db/register-message-proxy-instance.ts register pluralbuddy https://<instance-host> "<display-name>"
   bun scripts/db/register-message-proxy-instance.ts inspect
   ```

   For PluralKit, use `pluralkit` as the service. Registration checks discovery but does not prove
   that the bot writes lookup records.
2. For PluralBuddy, register a separate OAuth application on that instance with the same loopback
   callback pattern as above. Authorize it using the instance ID returned by registration:

   ```sh
   bun scripts/db/authorize-pluralbuddy-instance.ts <instance-id> <callback-url>
   ```

   Repeat this authorization command to replace credentials or recover from a revoked refresh
   token. The helper writes the replacement connection only after a successful code exchange.
   PluralKit's public message lookup does not need this step.
3. From a message written by the matching proxy bot, record its Discord repost ID and sender
   account ID. Check that the instance API resolves that repost, then enable it:

   ```sh
   bun scripts/db/register-message-proxy-instance.ts enable <instance-id> <repost-id> <sender-id>
   ```

   The command checks discovery and requires a lookup result for that exact repost and sender.
   A `401` or a reachable URL alone does not pass. For a new fork, also complete an integrated
   TomoriBot check in a disposable deployment before offering it to ordinary users. Keep the
   instance disabled on the main deployment until its bot write, OAuth code exchange and refresh
   (if applicable), and TomoriBot lookup have passed.
4. Users select the enabled instance with `/personal message-proxy service:pluralbuddy instance:<name>`.
   Leaving `instance` empty chooses the official instance. The choice is checked again when the
   command runs; disabling an instance stops new lookups without changing stored profiles.

Disable or remove a custom instance with:

```sh
bun scripts/db/register-message-proxy-instance.ts disable <instance-id>
bun scripts/db/register-message-proxy-instance.ts remove <instance-id>
```

Removal deletes its PluralBuddy OAuth connection and keeps a hidden catalog row so identities,
memories, and message attribution still resolve. That origin cannot be registered again after
removal; use `disable` when you may need to resume the same instance. Catalog changes take effect on the next command
or lookup without restarting TomoriBot. The [PluralBuddy support page](/features/integrations/pluralbuddy-support/)
explains what users can expect. See the [message-proxy architecture](/architecture/integrations/message-proxy/)
for token storage and refresh behavior.
