TomoriBot's behavior (what she is allowed to do and how she generates) is controlled
by `/config` > Permissions and `/config`, beyond personality
([Multiple Personas](/features/chatting-personality/multiple-personas/)) and knowledge
([Memory](/features/knowledge/memory/)). This page covers the most common settings.

## Capabilities: What She's Allowed to Do
<!-- anchor: capabilities-what-shes-allowed-to-do -->

`/config` > Plugins controls tools, context additions, and optional response review:

- **Available Tools**: image generation, sticker usage, thread creation, message management,
  user blocking, self-teaching, voice messages, and more. Each toggle gates the matching tool
  (see [Tools & Extensions](/features/capabilities/tools-and-extensions/)), so turning off
  Tool Use disables all of them at once.
- **Context Additions**: personalization, emojis in replies, and time awareness. These add
  information to her prompt, so they continue working when Tool Use is disabled.

Automatic short-term memory summarization is toggled in `/config` > Behavior > Advanced Memory.
When a capability is turned off, she cannot perform that action regardless of user requests.


## Response drafting

Open `/config` > `Plugins` > `Response Drafting` to turn review On. It starts Off and applies to
every persona in that workspace, including queued replies and generated scenes. Guild managers
change guild settings; your DM workspace has its own settings.

When On, Tomori holds her reply while a reviewer checks its character voice and scene fit. The
reviewer can ask for one complete revision. Tool requests also enter review before execution;
rejected requests can receive a bounded correction. Successful actions are retained while the
reply is revised. Text still uses the usual persona identity, emoji handling, and formatting.
Review and revisions can increase response time and token cost; the page shows this in both states.

`Choose Reviewer Model` selects an eligible registered text model. `Use current response model`
uses the model and credentials actually answering, including your personal provider or a fallback.
A pinned reviewer uses the workspace's own registration and credentials. Text-only authors and
authors with Tool Use disabled can still use an eligible reviewer. An unsupported inherited model
shows `Unavailable`; choose a supported reviewer to enable detailed review.

`Set Prompt` edits the review instructions, up to 4,000 characters. `Use Default` restores the
persona-aware default. `Choose Rule Checker` selects an already registered compatible MCP checker,
or `None`. Its findings go privately to the reviewer, which decides whether they matter for this
character. The checker has no validated language/profile guarantee in this release.

`Choose Decisions Model` saves a Decision registration from `/providers`. Skipping detailed review
is inactive until each model and review rubric has labeled quality evidence. A saved selection
makes no paid Decision requests in this release. Custom prompts also keep skipping inactive.
Clearing either model restores reviewer inheritance or `None`; turning Off keeps your choices.

Review is optional quality checking. A refusal, unavailable model, timeout, incomplete evidence, or
exhausted review budget lets an otherwise valid reply or independent tool request continue under
ordinary application rules. Previously rejected actions stay blocked. `/kill` and follow-up
interruption discard held text. Files, voice, and remote posts receive review of their proposed tool
arguments; their generated media is outside the held-text review. Hidden generation and user
impersonation keep their existing paths. Provider judgment and checker usefulness still need human
evaluation. See [review data handling](/features/knowledge/data-handling/#response-drafting-selections).

## Expressions
<!-- anchor: expressions -->

Expressions let your personas react with more than words. She can use your server's emojis and
stickers, and you can give her reactions of your own: a favorite GIF, an inside-joke image, or a link
to anything on the web. Describe when each one fits, and she sends it when the moment comes.

Members with Manage Server open `/expressions manage` to browse everything in three tabs: `Emojis`,
`Stickers`, and `Customs`.

### Your Server's Emojis and Stickers

Run `/expressions initialize` and she looks at each emoji and sticker to learn when it fits. Ones
added later show as uninitialized in `/expressions manage` until you run it again. To correct her,
select one and choose `Edit` to change its description and emotion, or `Clear Info` to erase them.

### Custom Expressions

In `Customs`, open the menu and choose `+ Add a custom expression`. Give it a name, a description of
when to use it, an emotion, and either a link or a file. She reads the description to decide when to
send it, so be specific: "when chat gets unhinged" works better than "funny".

A link can point to anything. She posts it exactly as saved, and Discord shows it the way it shows
any link: a GIF link from a site like Tenor plays as a GIF, an image link shows the image, and a
website shows its preview card. That makes links good for jokes, like a hospital's website for the
moment chat gets unhinged. Links must start with `https://`.

Files can be PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, or MP4, up to 10 MB.

Every persona can use a new custom expression. To keep one for specific personas, select it and use
`Add Persona`. Removing the last persona from that list opens it to everyone again.

### How She Uses Them

With Sticker Usage on in `/config` > Plugins, she sends at most one expression per reply, as its own
message before, between, or after her text. She doesn't use them in
[roleplay channels](/features/chatting-personality/chatting-and-triggers/#roleplay-channels).
`/expressions manage` shows how many times personas have used each one.

## Generation Tuning
<!-- anchor: generation-tuning -->

- `/config` > Models > Text Samplers & Parameters: sampling parameters such as temperature
  and top-p. Higher temperature yields more variety.
- `/config` > Behavior > General Behavior: response humanizer degree. Adjust how casually she
  texts. The setting applies server-wide by default, or to an individual persona.
- `/config` > Behavior > General Behavior: message history limit. Raise it for deeper
  conversational context, or lower it to save tokens.

## System Prompt
<!-- anchor: system-prompt -->

The system prompt sits above the persona and shapes overall behavior:

- `/config` > Behavior > General Behavior: set a custom system instruction (up to 16,000 characters).
- `/config` > Behavior > General Behavior: choose from preset system prompts.
- `/config` > Behavior > General Behavior: reset to default. The confirmation shows the previous
  prompt so you can restore it if cleared accidentally.

When a [SillyTavern preset](/features/integrations/sillytavern-support/) is active, the built-in
fallback system prompt is replaced, but a custom one you set here is still sent.

## Uncensored Output
<!-- anchor: uncensored-output -->

TomoriBot has no content filter of its own: she adds no moderation layer on top of the model,
and replies with whatever the provider generates. `/nsfw jailbreaks` does not enable hidden
bot features; it works around provider-side filters that are stricter than desired.

It toggles three independent techniques (all off by default):

- **Prompt injection**: adds an instruction block to the context to steer the model away
  from unnecessary refusals.
- **Unicode spaces**: swaps normal spaces for look-alike Unicode spaces so keyword filters
  do not trigger on phrases, applied to both the prompt and her reply.
- **Sanitize**: obfuscates sensitive words for the same reason, on both requests and replies.

None of these change what the model can do; they only reduce how often a provider filter
blocks otherwise normal output. Some of these options are age-restricted; see
[Age-Restricted Commands](/features/setup-administration/age-restricted-commands/).

## Appearance & Time

- `/config` > Persona > Identity & Personality: what she calls herself.
- `/config` > Behavior > General Behavior: the server timezone, used for time-aware replies and scheduled tasks.
