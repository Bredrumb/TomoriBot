TomoriBot provides server managers with fine-grained control over usage, costs, permissions,
and channels through `/moderation` and `/config`. Most of these controls require the
`Manage Server` permission. For a complete list of commands, see the
[Command Reference](/features/command-reference/).

## Cost Control: Quotas
<!-- anchor: cost-control-quotas -->

Generation costs money, whether paid from your provider account or by your members. Quotas cap
usage per user and server-wide:

- **Configure limits**: in `/moderation` > Quotas, configure daily per-user limits and
  server-wide reset pools for text, image, and video generation. Set a per-user limit to `0`
  for unlimited.
- **Manual resets**: run `/quota reset user` to clear a member's daily usage, or
  `/quota reset global` to reset the entire server's pool.

Server-wide pools reset automatically on a configurable interval in days.

## User BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
<!-- anchor: user-byok-bring-your-own-key -->

In `/moderation` > Member Access, you can control whether members may use server-funded AI:

- **Server Models Allowed** (default): members use server-configured providers.
- **Personal Providers Required**: members must configure their own API keys via
  `/personal providers`. The server pays nothing for member-initiated messages.
  Server-initiated actions (such as automated greetings or scheduled tasks) still use the server
  provider.

Members configure their personal providers under
[Personalization](/features/knowledge/personalization/#your-own-providers).

You can also bootstrap a server without a server-side text provider by choosing `User BYOK`
during `/setup`.

## Access Control: Whitelists

Use `/moderation` > Whitelist to restrict where and how TomoriBot responds:

- **Channels**: choose which channels allow bot responses and set channel-specific cooldown
  overrides. Channels inherit the global cooldown unless an override is set.
- **Personas**: restrict which channels a specific persona can trigger in.
- **Roles**: restrict bot interactions to members with specific Discord roles.

Configure the server-wide global response cooldown under `/config` > Behavior >
Trigger Behavior.

## Learning & Privacy Controls

- **Member permissions**: in `/moderation` > Member Access, click `Edit Permissions` to control
  whether members without `Manage Server` can manage server memories, persona attributes,
  sample dialogues, or inspect prompt snapshots.
- **User Blacklist**: in `/moderation` > User Blacklist, choose members for TomoriBot to ignore
  completely. Blacklisted members cannot trigger her or run commands, and their messages never
  reach prompt context. You can also set persona-specific member blocks.
- **Channel Rules**: in `/config` > Channels > Channel Rules, mark private channels (where
  short-term memory stays isolated and thought logs are suppressed) and cross-channel tool
  blocklists.

## Transparency: Thought Logs

In `/config` > Channels > Logs & Welcome, click `Set Log Channel` to designate a channel where
TomoriBot posts her internal reasoning, fallback notices, and successful tool calls. This is
useful for auditing what she is doing, including which trigger exposed a tool in
[Deliberate Tool Mode](/features/capabilities/tools-and-extensions/#deliberate-tool-mode).

## Welcome Greetings

In `/config` > Channels > Logs & Welcome, configure automated greetings for new members in a
chosen channel. TomoriBot waits until the new member completes Discord's rules screening and
onboarding before sending the greeting. If a member leaves before finishing screening, no greeting
is sent. Click `Clear Welcome` on that same page to disable greetings.

## Expressions

Run `/expressions initialize` to index your server's custom emojis and stickers so personas can
use them accurately in conversation. For how personas use emojis, stickers, and reactions, see
[Expressions & Reactions](/features/chatting-personality/chatting-and-triggers/#expressions--reactions).
